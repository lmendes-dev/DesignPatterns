# Design Patterns

# Creational

- Abstract Factory:
  • Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

- Builder:
  • Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the creation of different representations.

- Factory Method:
  • Defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.

- Prototype:
  • Creates new objects by copying an existing object, enabling the efficient creation of new instances.

- Singleton:
  • Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
